Polygon Area Calculator (Python)

A Python console application that calculates the area of a polygon using the Shoelace formula. Works for any polygon by taking vertex coordinates as input.

Project Overview

This project demonstrates Python programming, lists, loops, and mathematical computation. Users can input the coordinates of a polygon’s vertices, and the program computes the area accurately.

Features

Calculates area for any polygon with 3 or more vertices

Works for convex and concave polygons

Input coordinates interactively via console

Simple and user-friendly interface

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Mathematical computation (Shoelace formula)

Console input/output
